# Assignment Review## Basanta BistaI think you did a great jon doing the assignment.You looked at all the important bits in the Data inspection section.  The files you made for each chromosomes look good and they have all the headings intact letting the reader know which polymorphism does the data represent. Your description are very thorough and detailed.  You have interesting graphs.Only suggestion I have is to play around with the dimensions of the graphs so that the labels are clearer.  Other than that I have no complains.It was a job well done.
